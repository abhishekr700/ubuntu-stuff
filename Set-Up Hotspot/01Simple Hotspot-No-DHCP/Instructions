##Starting HOTSPOT

1. Install hostapd
2. Configure hostapd.conf file.
3. Run command 
	hostapd hostapd.conf
4. Note: 
	1)This hotspot will be seen but noone would be able to connect unless you have a DHCP server to assign
	  IP addresses to clients.
	2)Better do 
		airmon-ng check
		airmon-ng check kill
	before doing all these steps. Otherwise hotspot stops suddenly in between.

##Troubleshooting

Link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/472794/hostapd-error-nl80211-could-not-configure-driver-mode

My Work :  I just used
		service network-manager stop
	This stopped the service and after I was done, I restarted it by
		service network-manager restart

	To keep using wifi via other adapter, follow Answer 1 below, and afterwards, turn on PCI wifi (this will stop hotspot)
	and then restart hostapd.

Answer Suggested 1: 
	As @bain has rightly pointed out, there is a bug raised in launchpad for this very purpose.
	Run commands : <Replace wlano & IP accordingly>

		sudo nmcli nm wifi off
		sudo rfkill unblock wlan

		sudo ifconfig wlan0 10.15.0.1/24 up
		sleep 1
		sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart
		sudo service hostapd restart

	The first two lines stop wlan from network manager, and then unblocks the interface, so ifconfig can work.

	UPDATE: But if for the first command you get the error message Error: Object 'nm' is unknown then use this instead:

		sudo nmcli radio wifi off

	The next commands uses ifconfig to bring up wlan and allows a second's delay, 
	then restart the dhcp server (though I did not need this restart in my setup), and finally start the hostapd service.

	It should now start w/o any issues.

Answer Suggested 2: 

	I just had this error on Raspberry pi running Kali linux and hostapd 2.4 I suspected it is because 
	some other network processes are keeping the interface busy, so I ran this airmon-ng command that checks and kills and 
	processes that might use the wifi card:

		airmon-ng check kill

	To just see any network processes without killing them, use airmon-ng check. After I killed them, I started hostapd again
	 and no errors came up anymore.

	For some other network functionality you might need those processes, I restarted the raspberry for that, 
	but they can also be started individually.
