3.Follow any on-screen prompts to check for, install and apply any changes 

###5. Enable ‘Minimise on Click' =>

That may be, but it is not the default behaviour in Unity — which can be off-putting to new users. It’s also not obvious how to enable it.

Run the following command (or install/use Unity Tweak Tool > Unity > Launcher > Minimise):

gsettings set org.compiz.unityshell:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/ launcher-minimize-window true
